A Dota 2 international matches classification
Dota 2 international statistics
This is a fun project that I built, my objective is to understand the most important characteristics and performance statistic of a team that won a Dota 2 International math!

Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. Players control a powerful character, called a "hero", and work with a team to defeat the other team's heroes. The game is set on a virtual battlefield and players use different strategies and abilities to defeat the enemy team. It is a very popular e-sport game, with many professional players and tournaments with large prize pools.

The International is an annual esports tournament for Dota 2. It is organized and produced by Valve, the company that developed Dota 2. The tournament features teams from around the world competing for a large prize pool, which is crowdfunded by the Dota 2 community through the sale of in-game items. The International is considered the most prestigious tournament in the Dota 2 professional scene and is often referred to as the "World Championship" of Dota 2. It is also one of the largest esports tournaments in terms of prize pool, with the total prize money for the tournament often surpassing tens of millions of dollars.

The notebook uses a dataset from the Dota 2 open api which contains information about matches, leagues, players and much more. Using this data we build an XGBoost model to predict if a playerâ€™s team will win based off statistics of how that player played the match.
